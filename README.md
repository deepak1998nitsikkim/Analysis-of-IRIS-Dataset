# Iris Flower Classification Using Decision Tree Algorithm 

The provided Python code demonstrates a machine learning workflow using the Iris dataset and a Decision Tree classifier. It first loads the dataset, which includes features (flower measurements) and target labels (species). The data is then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). A Decision Tree classifier is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test data. The model's performance is evaluated by calculating the accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions, and the result is printed as both a decimal and a percentage. This process showcases the steps of loading data, training a model, making predictions, and evaluating performance in a classification task.
